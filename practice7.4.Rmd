my pearson.test function: 

```{r}
library (psych)
library (tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(car)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
rairuoho <- read.table('/Users/germayne/testrepo_a/rairuoho.txt', header = TRUE, sep = "\t", dec = ".")
x<-rairuoho$day3
y<-rairuoho$day4
z<-rairuoho$day8
x1<- subset(rairuoho, treatment == "water")$day3
x2<- subset(rairuoho, treatment == "nutrient")$day3
y1<- subset(rairuoho, treatment == "water")$day4
y2<- subset(rairuoho, treatment == "nutrient")$day4
z1<- subset(rairuoho, treatment == "water")$day8
z2<- subset(rairuoho, treatment == "nutrient")$day8


# pearson test function for day3 and day4, nutrient
pearson.test <- function(x, y) {
  cor_val <- cor(x, y, method = "pearson")  # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient
  n <- length(x)
  t_val <- cor_val * sqrt((n - 2) / (1 - cor_val^2))  # Calculate t-statistic
  df <- n - 2  # Degrees of freedom
  p_val <- 2 * pt(abs(t_val), df, lower.tail = FALSE)  # Calculate two-tailed p-value
  result <- list(correlation = cor_val, p_value = p_val)
  return(result)
}

pearson.test(x,y)

pearson.test(x,z)

pearson.test(x,y)

pearson.test(x1,y1) #water; day3 vs day4
pearson.test(x2, y2) #nutrient; day3 vs day4
pearson.test(x1, z1) #water; day3 vs day8
pearson.test(x2,z2) #nutrient; day3 vs day8



```

intepretation of results:

for day3 and day4, the correlation is stronger than with day3 and day8 in general. This could be due to the longer time between day3 and day8, which allows for more chances for changes in developmental growth, as compared to the short span of time between day3 and day4, which are consecutive days

the p-values for day3 and day4 are smaller than for day3 and day8, thus this indicates a greater confidence in correlation for day3 and day4
